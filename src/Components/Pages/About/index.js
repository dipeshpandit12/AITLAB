              I am Subasish. I grew up in Chattogram, Bangladesh. I am a
              tenure-track Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering program
              (Ingram School of Engineering) at Texas State University.
              Previously, I worked as an Associate Research Scientist at Texas
              A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) for almost 7 years. I am still
              affiliated with TTI as a part time employee. I have more than 13
              years of experience related to roadway safety, traffic operation,
              and CAV technologies. I am a Systems Engineer by training with
              hands on experience on Six Sigma and Lean Engineering. My major
              areas of expertise include database management, statistical
              analysis and machine learning with emphasis in safety and
              transportation operations, spatial analysis with modern web GIS
              tools, computer programming (R, python, VBA, html, and
              javascript), interactive data visualization, and deep learning
              tools for CV/AV technologies.
              <br />
              <br />I have published more than 120 technical reports, and
              journal articles. I am an active member of ITE, and ASCE. I am an
              Eno Fellow. I recently served as vice-president of membership of
              Young Professionals in Transportation Houston chapter.

          Traffic Technology International: A Conversation with Subasish Das

          Researchers at Texas A&M Transportation Institute are using AI to
          predict exactly where and when crashes will occur so that road
          authorities can prioritise funding for safety improvements in a more
          targeted fashion than ever before. Whereas traditionally such
          predictions would be made using a simple statistical model, AI
          algorithms can deliver much more accurate predictions, even down to
          the time of day an accident is likely to occur on a particular stretch
          of road. Traffic Technology International interviewed Subasish Das on
          this issue. This issue was featured in Texas Transportation

              Q: Can AI algorithms deliver much more accurate predictions?

            <Text fontSize="lg" color="gray.700" lineHeight="taller">
              In the conventional model we just use roadway geometric
              information and traffic volume. But other data such as operating
              speed — which is very important in predicting crash severity — and
              weather conditions, are never used in the statistical model. In
              the AI tools we can import this kind of granular information,
              which helps us to make it much more accurate. In conventional
              statistical models, we develop annual crash predictions. So, we
              can say that on that road, annually, 20 crashes will happen. But
              in one AI project I recently finished for USDOT for their Safety
              Data Initiative project, we developed a daily model. And we are
              now trying to get even more detail, down to daytime crashes versus
              nighttime crashes.

            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" color="gray.700" lineHeight="taller">
              Conventional statistical models cannot process big data and data
              stream related problems. We need some advanced AI to get that done
              and from there we can offer predictions that are daily or even
              hourly. Once the predictions are delivered, road authorities can
              view them on a heat map to help decide in which areas they will
              invest in countermeasures in an attempt to improve safety and cool
              the accident hot spots.

              Artificial Intelligence in Highway Safety provides cutting-edge
              advances in highway safety using AI. The author is a highway
              safety expert. He pursues highway safety within its contexts,
              while drawing attention to the predictive powers of the AI
              techniques in solving complex problems for safety improvement.
              This book provides both theoretical and practical aspects of
              highway safety. Each chapter contains theory and its contexts in
              plain language with several real-life examples. It is suitable for
              anyone interested in highway safety and AI and it provides an
              illuminating and accessible introduction to this fast-growing
              research trend. Material supplementing the book can be found at
              https://github.com/subasish/AI_in_HighwaySafety. It offers a
              variety of supplemental materials, including data sets and R
              codes.
